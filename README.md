# git-overview
a git command to display an overview of the status of many git projects at once.

Run this command from a directory containing many other git directories and it will fetch and display the status of all your git repository.
This is git and ASCII art :-)

Either run `git-overview` from the command line or add `git-overview` in a directory your `$PATH`. For example, putting it in `${HOME}/.local/bin` is a good idea. Then you can do `git overview` instead and integrate it into your `git` workflow.
